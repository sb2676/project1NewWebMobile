        <p id="para">I studied and finished school in the USA, after I graduated i took some courses
            for Frontend development and learned about Java Script, HTML, and CSS. I also
             learned how to use some design websites like figma. I am currently studying at a private university
            called RIT(Rochester Institute of Technology) and am expanding my skill set. Some of my favorite
            Hobbies include drawing, cooking, and watching some of my favorite shows, but what I enjoy most is playing video games.
            I dream to one day become a game developer and help create the future foundation of new gen games.
