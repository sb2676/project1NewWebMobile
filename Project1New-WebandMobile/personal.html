        <p class="para">I enjoy gaming because of many reasons, but mainly it's because of the stories you get to experience. you get to immerse yourself in all kinds of worlds and stories. I love the diversity of gaming and how it doesn't matter who you are or what you like, you can find a game that you enjoy.

        <p class="para">I love taking walks, the places where I love to walk the most are beaches, parks, forests, and 
            generally anywhere where it's quiet. It's very calming and gives time to reflect on your day.

        <div class="bg"><h3>Cooking</h3></div>
        <p class="para">I enjoy cooking because it's therapeutic for me. You always get to experiment
            with different ingredients and tastes. I love how in cooking you don't necessarily need
            experience to be good at it, you just need the ingredients for the dish and instructions
            on how to prepare it.
