            <p>KFC has taught me the importance of teamwork and communication in a fast-paced work
                environment, as every shift required coordination with my colleagues to ensure
                customer satisfaction. I also gained valuable skills in time management
                and problem-solving, which helped me handle high-pressure situations.

            <p>When you work at a small coffee shop you learn a lot because sometimes you
                are the only ones working and you have to manage juggling all the tasks.
                That includes inventory, cleaning, and making the coffee. You don't see a lot of people often, so over
                time you start to recognize daily customers and you build a sense of community over
                time and learn to cherish the little things.  
            </p>
